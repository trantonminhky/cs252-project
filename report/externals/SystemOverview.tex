\section{System Overview}
\subsection{Main Stakeholders}

\textbf{Authenticity seekers:} cannot find back-
stage elements or specific cultural filters
through generic search.

\textbf{Foreigners:} Find online information
about cultural spots overwhelming,
generic, and repetitive.
\subsection{Core Functions}
\subsubsection{Granular Search Service}

The search pipeline is built upon a hybrid architecture that combines semantic search and lexical search techniques to optimize both relevance and precision in results. The key components of this pipeline are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Data Embedding and Indexing:} The system utilizes \textbf{ChromaDB} as a vector database. To enhance retrieval accuracy, raw data from architecture and restaurant CSVs is pre-processed into descriptively refined documents before being embedded. We utilize the state-of-the-art \texttt{BAAI/bge-m3} sentence transformer model to generate these vector embeddings.

  \item \textbf{Hybrid Retrieval:} The retrieval phase fuses two distinct methodologies.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textit{Semantic Search:} Calculates \textbf{cosine similarity} between the user's query vector and stored document vectors to find the top 10 conceptually relevant results.
          \item \textit{Lexical Search:} Utilizes the \textbf{BM25} algorithm to identify the top 10 results based on exact keyword matching.
        \end{itemize}
        These results are combined using a weighted fusion mechanism with an alpha ratio ($\alpha$) of $0.65$. This weighting prioritizes semantic search (understanding user intent) while retaining the precision of keyword matching for specific entity names.

  \item \textbf{Reranking:} The combined pool of candidates undergoes a final filtering stage using the \texttt{BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3} model. This cross-encoder assesses the relevance of each candidate pair deeply, adding precision and selecting the final top 3 results to be returned to the client.
